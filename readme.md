# Udacity Memory Game
---
A take on the classic game of concentration. There are 16 tiles on the board.
Turn over cards two at a time to find a match. The game is completed when all
8 pairs have been matched. Race against the clock and see how high of a rating
you can achieve.

## Purpose
---
Completed for Udacity's Front End Development Nanodegree.

## Bugs
---
The current build of the game allows for more than 2 cards to be turned over
at once (if you can click fast enough). Be wary if you intentionally click over
multiple cards at once; you may need to reload the page for proper functionality
to be restored.
